description: Create a sandbox test file for experimental components and visual QA.
---

1. Create a `sandbox/` directory in the current project root if it does not already exist.
2. Draft all experimental code, visual components, or A/B tests inside this `sandbox/` directory. 
3. Never overwrite the main production files during a sandbox test run.
4. When finished, provide the user with the direct path to the newly created sandbox file so they can preview it in their browser.
